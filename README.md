# A-Permissioned-Blockchain-on-Avalanche Network
Currently, preserving critical data is a vital challenge. To address this challenge, we can use a permissioned blockchain-based model on the Avalanche network to protect sensetive data in an immutable environment accessible only to authorized participants.
To create this permissioned blockchain, we employ the Avalanche Subnet-EVM and a custom genesis file. Then, we record data within a single transaction on a permissioned block.
